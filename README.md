## Introduction

House price prediction is a crucial task in the real estate industry. Accurate predictions can help buyers, sellers, and investors make informed decisions. In this project, we use linear regression, a fundamental machine learning technique, to predict house prices based on multiple features such as the number of rooms, location, and size.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains various features of houses and their corresponding prices. The key features include:

- **Number of rooms**
- **House size (square feet)**
- **Location**
- **Year built**
- **Lot size**
- **Number of bathrooms**

## Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing steps undertaken include:

1. **Handling Missing Values**: Replacing or imputing missing values in the dataset.
2. **Encoding Categorical Variables**: Converting categorical variables into numerical format using techniques like one-hot encoding.
3. **Feature Scaling**: Normalizing the feature values to ensure they are on a similar scale.
4. **Splitting Data**: Dividing the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance.

## Model Building

The model used in this project is a linear regression model. The key steps involved in building the model are:

1. **Feature Selection**: Identifying the most relevant features for the prediction task.
2. **Model Training**: Training the linear regression model using the training dataset.
3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimizing model parameters to improve performance.

## Model Evaluation

The model's performance is evaluated using the following metrics:

- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**
- **R-squared (RÂ²) Score**

## Results

The results of the model evaluation indicate the accuracy and efficiency of the linear regression model in predicting house prices. Key findings include:

- **Model Accuracy**: The R-squared score indicating the proportion of variance explained by the model.
- **Error Metrics**: MAE, MSE, and RMSE values showing the average prediction error.

## Conclusion

The linear regression model built in this project successfully predicts house prices with a reasonable level of accuracy. The model demonstrates the importance of feature selection and preprocessing in building effective predictive models.

## Future Work

Future improvements to the project could include:

- **Using more advanced regression techniques** such as Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, or Polynomial Regression.
- **Incorporating additional features** to enhance the model's predictive power.
- **Exploring other machine learning algorithms** like Decision Trees, Random Forests, or Gradient Boosting for potentially better performance.
